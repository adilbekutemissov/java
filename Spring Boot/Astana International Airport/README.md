### Documentation
In the cp2 folder, we have queries for Postman to test the functionality of the application and documentation about the application

### Experience
By implementing this project we learned how to build RESTful web services with Spring Boot Framework in Java.
This project also introduced us into the problem of cross site request forgery by separating a web application into a fronend and backend. All of
this included learning about request, persisting,structuring a REST service.
Positives:
Learning Spring
Learning about GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests implementation
Work with JPArepository
Trivial Frontend implementation
Using Postman for query testing
Negatives:
Multiple compound primary key made us cry sometimes
Hard to debug
